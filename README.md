### Hello! I'm Elijah 👋

<img align="right" width="250" alt="math3d" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37519236/184224189-e0d679e5-8752-4e64-8bb8-da49c36a9d4a.png">

👨‍🎓 I'm an undergrad at UMass Amherst studying computer science and statistics. I'm graduating this spring (thank goodness)

🤿 I’m currently working at [The Young People's Project](https://www.typp.org), a STEM education equity non-profit. Over the summer I taught CS and math workshops to high schoolers in Boston, but I've since transitioned to working as a web developer working on a number of new online initiatives!

🌱 I’m learning how to slow down and prioritize my emotional and spiritual health.

<!--
In addition to CS, I'm passionate about using technology for education. Whether it's [making calculus visualizations](https://elijahcalc.netlify.app/euler/) or [visualizing rudimentary machine learning concepts](https://beautifuldatascience.netlify.app/), I love creating tools that help students learn more effectively.
