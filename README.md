### Hello!

I'm Elijah, a student at UMass Amherst studying computer science and statistics. Frontend development is my forte, but I've been messing with full stack technologies as well for a while now. TypeScript will always have my heart, no matter the stack :)

My last internship was at RelationalAI where I created a data-informed, interactive diagram component for a user training website written with TS, Next.js, and TailwindCSS.

In addition to CS, I'm passionateÂ about using technology for education. Whether it's [making calculus visualizations](https://elijahcalc.netlify.app/euler/) or [visualizing rudimentary machine learning concepts](https://beautifuldatascience.netlify.app/), I love creating tools that help students learn more effectively.
