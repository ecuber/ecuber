### Hello!

I'm Elijah, an undergraduate computer science student at UMass Amherst 🧑🏽‍💻🐒. I'm most into web development—frontend is my forte, but I've been messing with full stack technologies as well for a while now. TypeScript will always have my heart ❤️

My last internship was at RelationalAI where I created a data-informed, interactive diagram component for a user training website written with TS, Next.js, and TailwindCSS 🌊.

In addition to CS, I'm passionate about using technology for education. Whether it's [making calculus visualizations](https://elijahcalc.netlify.app/euler/) or [visualizing rudimentary machine learning concepts](https://beautifuldatascience.netlify.app/), I love creating tools that help students learn more effectively.
